<h2><a name="EDITORS_PREFACE" id="EDITORS_PREFACE"></a>EDITOR'S PREFACE.</h2>


<p>"Turner's <i>Harbors of England</i>," as it is generally called,
is a book which, for various reasons, has never received from
readers of Mr. Ruskin's writings the attention it deserves.
True, it has always been sought after by connoisseurs, and
collectors never fail with their eleven or twelve guineas whenever
a set of Artist's Proofs of the First Edition of 1856
comes into the market. But to the General Reader the book
with its twelve exquisitely delicate mezzotints&mdash;four of which
Mr. Ruskin has declared to be among the very finest executed
by Turner from his marine subjects&mdash;is practically unknown.</p>

<p>The primary reason for this neglect is not far to seek.
Since 1877 no new edition of the work has been published,
and thus it has gradually passed from public knowledge,
though still regarded with lively interest by those to whom
Mr. Ruskin's words&mdash;particularly words written in further
unfolding of the subtleties of Turner's art&mdash;at all times
appeal so strongly.</p>

<p>In his own preface Mr. Ruskin has told us all that in 1856
it was necessary to know of the genesis of the <i>Harbors</i>. That
account may now be supplemented with the following additional
facts. In 1826 Turner (in conjunction with Lupton,
the engraver) projected and commenced a serial publication
entitled <i>The Ports of England</i>. But both artist and engraver
lacked the opportunity required to carry the undertaking
to a successful conclusion, and three numbers only
were completed. Each of these contained two engravings.
Part I., introducing <i>Scarborough</i> and <i>Whitby</i>, duly appeared
in 1826; Part II., with <i>Dover</i> and <i>Ramsgate</i>, in 1827; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>in 1828 Part III., containing <i>Sheerness</i> and <i>Portsmouth</i>,
closed the series.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Twenty-eight years afterwards (that is,
in 1856, five years after Turner's death) these six plates, together
with six new ones, were published by Messrs. E. Gambart
&amp; Co., at whose invitation Mr. Ruskin consented to write
the essay on Turner's marine painting which accompanied
them. The book, a handsome folio, appears to have been immediately
successful, for in the following year a second edition
was called for. This was a precise reprint of the 1856
edition; but, unhappily, the delicate plates already began to
exhibit signs of wear. The copyright (which had not been
retained by Mr. Ruskin, but remained the property of Messrs.
E. Gambart &amp; Co.) then passed to Messrs. Day &amp; Son, who,
after producing the third edition of 1859, in turn disposed
of it to Mr. T. J. Allman. Allman issued a fourth edition
in 1872, and then parted with his rights to Messrs. Smith,
Elder &amp; Co., who in 1877 brought out the fifth, and, until
now, last edition. Since that date the work has been out
of print, and has remained practically inaccessible to the
ordinary reader.</p>

<p>It is matter for congratulation that at length means have
been found to bring <i>The Harbors of England</i> once more into
currency, and to issue the book through Mr. George Allen at
a price which will place it within the reach of the reading
public at large.</p>

<p>The last edition of 1877, with its worn and "retouched"
plates,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> was published at twenty-five shillings; less than a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>third of that sum will suffice to procure a copy of this new
issue in which the prints (save for their reduced size) more
nearly approach the clearness and beauty of the originals of
1856 than any of the three editions which have immediately
preceded it.</p>

<p>I have before me the following interesting letter addressed
by Mr. Ruskin's father to Mr. W. Smith Williams, for many
years literary adviser to Messrs. Smith, Elder &amp; Co.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><cite>"<span class="smcap">Chamouni</span>, <i>August 4th, 1856.</i></cite></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I hear that in <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i> of 26th
July there is a good article on my son's <i>Harbors of England</i>,
and I should be greatly obliged by Mr. Gordon Smith sending
me that number.&hellip;</p>

<p>"The history of this book, I believe, I told you. Gambart,
the French publisher and picture dealer, said some 18
months ago that he was going to put out 12 Turner plates,
never published, of English Harbors, and he would give my
son two good Turner drawings for a few pages of text to
illustrate them.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> John agreed, and wrote the text, when
poorly in the spring of 1855, at Tunbridge Wells; and it
seems the work has just come out. It was in my opinion an
extremely well done thing, and more likely, as far as it went,
if not to be extremely popular, at least to be received without
cavil than anything he had written. If there is a very
favorable review in <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i> &hellip; it may tend to disarm
the critics, and partly influence opinion of his larger
works.&hellip;&mdash;With our united kind regards,</p>

<p><cite><span style="margin-right:4em;">"Yours very truly,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">John James Ruskin</span>."</cite></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p><p>In all save one particular the Text here given follows precisely
that of the previous issues. It has been the good fortune
of the present Editor to be able to restore a characteristic
passage suppressed from motives of prudence when the
work was originally planned.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> The proof-sheets of the first
edition, worked upon by Mr. Ruskin, were given by him to
his old nurse Anne.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> She, fortunately, carefully preserved
them, and in turn gave them to Mr. Allen, some ten years before
he became Mr. Ruskin's publisher. These proofs had
been submitted as they came from the press to Mr. W. H.
Harrison (well known to readers of <i>On the Old Road</i>, etc.,
as "My First Editor"), who marked them freely with notes
and suggestions. To one passage he appears to have taken
so decided an objection that its author was prevailed upon
to delete it. But, whilst deferring thus to the judgment of
others, and consenting to remove a sentence which he doubtless
regarded with particular satisfaction as expressing a decided
opinion upon a favorite picture, Mr. Ruskin indulged
in one of those pleasantries which now and again we observe
in his informal letters, though seldom, if ever, in his serious
writings. In the margin, below the canceled passage, he
wrote boldly: "<i>Sacrificed to the Muse of Prudence. J. R.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p>That Mr. Harrison was justified in raising objection to this
"moderate estimate" of Turner's picture will, I think, be
readily allowed. In those days Mr. Ruskin's influence was,
comparatively speaking, small; and the expression of an
opinion which heaped praise upon the single painting of a
partially understood painter at the expense of a great and
popular institution would only have served to arouse opposition,
and possibly to attract ridicule. It is different to-day.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>We know the keen enthusiasm of the author of <i>The Seven
Lamps</i>, and have seen again and again how he expresses
himself in terms of somewhat exaggerated admiration when
writing of a painter whom he appreciates, or a picture that he
loves. To us this enthusiasm is an attractive characteristic.
It has never been permitted to distort the vision or cloud the
critical faculty; and we follow the teaching of the Master
all the more closely because we feel his fervor, and know
how completely he becomes possessed with a subject which
appeals to his imagination or his heart. I have therefore not
scrupled to revive the words which he consented to immolate
at the shrine of Prudence.</p>

<p>It is not my province here to enter into any criticism of
the pages which follow; but, for the benefit of those who are
not versed in the minuti&aelig; of Shelleyan topics, a word may be
said regarding Mr. Ruskin's reference<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> to the poet who met
his death in the Bay of Spezzia. The <i>Don Juan</i> was no
"traitorous" craft. Fuller and more authentic information
is to hand now than the meager facts at the disposal of a
writer in 1856; and we know that the greed of man, and not
the lack of sea-worthiness in his tiny vessel, caused Percy
Shelley to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">" &hellip; Suffer a sea change<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into something rich and strange."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is, unhappily, no longer any room for doubt that the
<i>Don Juan</i> was willfully run down by a felucca whose crew
coveted the considerable sum of money they believed Byron
to have placed on board, and cared nothing for the sacrifice of
human life in their eagerness to seize the gold.</p>

<p>The twelve engravings, to which reference has already
been made, have been reproduced by the photogravure process
from a selected set of early examples; and, in addition, the
plates so prepared have been carefully worked upon by Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>Allen himself. It will thus be apparent that everything
possible has been done to produce a worthy edition of a
worthy book, and to place in the hands of the public what to
the present generation of readers is tantamount to a new work
from a pen which&mdash;alas!&mdash;has now for so long a time been
still.</p>

<h2><a name="AUTHORS_ORIGINAL_PREFACE" id="AUTHORS_ORIGINAL_PREFACE"></a>AUTHOR'S ORIGINAL PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Among the many peculiarities which distinguished the
late J. M. W. Turner from other landscape painters, not
the least notable, in my apprehension, were his earnest desire
to arrange his works in connected groups, and his evident
intention, with respect to each drawing, that it should be
considered as expressing part of a continuous system of
thought. The practical result of this feeling was that he
commenced many series of drawings,&mdash;and, if any accident
interfered with the continuation of the work, hastily concluded
them,&mdash;under titles representing rather the relation
which the executed designs bore to the materials accumulated
in his own mind, than the position which they could justifiably
claim when contemplated by others. The <i>River Scenery</i>
was closed without a single drawing of a rapidly running
stream; and the prints of his annual tours were assembled,
under the title of the <i>Rivers of France</i>, without including
a single illustration either of the Rhone or the Garonne.</p>

<p>The title under which the following plates are now presented
to the public, is retained merely out of respect to this
habit of Turner's. Under that title he commenced the publication,
and executed the vignette for its title-page, intending
doubtless to make it worthy of taking rank with, if not
far above, the consistent and extensive series of the <i>Southern
Coast</i>, executed in his earlier years. But procrastination and
accident equally interfered with his purpose. The excellent
engraver Mr. Lupton, in co-operation with whom the work
was undertaken, was unfortunately also a man of genius, and
seems to have been just as capricious as Turner himself in the
application of his powers to the matter in hand. Had one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>of the parties in the arrangement been a mere plodding man
of business, the work would have proceeded; but between the
two men of talent it came very naturally to a stand. They
petted each other by reciprocal indulgence of delay; and at
Turner's death, the series, so magnificently announced under
the title of the <i>Harbors of England</i>, consisted only of twelve
plates, all the less worthy of their high-sounding title in that,
while they included illustrations of some of the least important
of the watering-places, they did not include any illustration
whatever of such harbors of England as Liverpool,
Shields, Yarmouth, or Bristol. Such as they were, however,
I was requested to undertake their illustration. As the offer
was made at a moment when much nonsense, in various
forms, was being written about Turner and his works; and
among the twelve plates there were four<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> which I considered
among the very finest that had been executed from his marine
subjects, I accepted the trust; partly to prevent the really
valuable series of engravings from being treated with injustice,
and partly because there were several features in them
by which I could render more intelligible some remarks I
wished to make on Turner's marine painting in general.</p>

<p>These remarks, therefore, I have thrown together, in a
connected form; less with a view to the illustration of these
particular plates, than of the general system of ship-painting
which was characteristic of the great artist. I have afterwards
separately noted the points which seemed to me most
deserving of attention in the plates themselves.</p>

<p>Of arch&aelig;ological information the reader will find none.
The designs themselves are, in most instances, little more
than spirited sea-pieces, with such indistinct suggestion of
local features in the distance as may justify the name given
to the subject; but even when, as in the case of the Dover and
Portsmouth, there is something approaching topographical
detail, I have not considered it necessary to lead the reader
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>into inquiries which certainly Turner himself never thought
of; nor do I suppose it would materially add to the interest
of these cloud distances or rolling seas, if I had the time&mdash;which
I have not&mdash;to collect the most complete information
respecting the raising of Prospect Rows, and the establishment
of circulating libraries.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_HARBORS_OF_ENGLAND" id="THE_HARBORS_OF_ENGLAND"></a>THE HARBORS OF ENGLAND.</h2>


<p>Of all things, living or lifeless, upon this strange earth,
there is but one which, having reached the mid-term of appointed
human endurance on it, I still regard with unmitigated
amazement. I know, indeed, that all around me is
wonderful&mdash;but I cannot answer it with wonder:&mdash;a dark
veil, with the foolish words, <span class="smcap lc">NATURE OF THINGS</span>, upon it,
casts its deadening folds between me and their dazzling
strangeness. Flowers open, and stars rise, and it seems to
me they could have done no less. The mystery of distant
mountain-blue only makes me reflect that the earth is of necessity
mountainous;&mdash;the sea-wave breaks at my feet, and I
do not see how it should have remained unbroken. But one
object there is still, which I never pass without the renewed
wonder of childhood, and that is the bow of a Boat. Not
of a racing-wherry, or revenue cutter, or clipper yacht; but
the blunt head of a common, bluff, undecked sea-boat, lying
aside in its furrow of beach sand. The sum of Navigation is
in that. You may magnify it or decorate as you will: you do
not add to the wonder of it. Lengthen it into hatchet-like
edge of iron,&mdash;strengthen it with complex tracery of ribs of
oak,&mdash;carve it and gild it till a column of light moves beneath
it on the sea,&mdash;you have made no more of it than it was at
first. That rude simplicity of bent plank, that can breast its
way through the death that is in the deep sea, has in it the
soul of shipping. Beyond this, we may have more work, more
men, more money; we cannot have more miracle.</p>

<p>For there is, first, an infinite strangeness in the perfection
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>of the thing, as work of human hands. I know nothing else
that man does, which is perfect, but that. All his other
doings have some sign of weakness, affectation, or ignorance
in them. They are overfinished or underfinished; they do not
quite answer their end, or they show a mean vanity in answering
it too well.</p>

<p>But the boat's bow is na&iuml;vely perfect: complete without an
effort. The man who made it knew not he was making anything
beautiful, as he bent its planks into those mysterious,
ever-changing curves. It grows under his hand into the image
of a sea-shell; the seal, as it were, of the flowing of the great
tides and streams of ocean stamped on its delicate rounding.
He leaves it when all is done, without a boast. It is simple
work, but it will keep out water. And every plank thence-forward
is a Fate, and has men's lives wreathed in the knots
of it, as the cloth-yard shaft had their deaths in its plumes.</p>

<p>Then, also, it is wonderful on account of the greatness of
the thing accomplished. No other work of human hands ever
gained so much. Steam-engines and telegraphs indeed help
us to fetch, and carry, and talk; they lift weights for us,
and bring messages, with less trouble than would have been
needed otherwise; this saving of trouble, however, does not
constitute a new faculty, it only enhances the powers we
already possess. But in that bow of the boat is the gift of
another world. Without it, what prison wall would be so
strong as that "white and wailing fringe" of sea. What
maimed creatures were we all, chained to our rocks, Andromeda-like,
or wandering by the endless shores; wasting our
incommunicable strength, and pining in hopeless watch of
unconquerable waves? The nails that fasten together the
planks of the boat's bow are the rivets of the fellowship of the
world. Their iron does more than draw lightning out of
heaven, it leads love round the earth.</p>

<p>Then also, it is wonderful on account of the greatness of
the enemy that it does battle with. To lift dead weight; to
overcome length of languid space; to multiply or systematize
a given force; this we may see done by the bar, or beam, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>wheel, without wonder. But to war with that living fury of
waters, to bare its breast, moment after moment, against the
unwearied enmity of ocean,&mdash;the subtle, fitful, implacable
smiting of the black waves, provoking each other on, endlessly,
all the infinite march of the Atlantic rolling on behind them
to their help,&mdash;and still to strike them back into a wreath of
smoke and futile foam, and win its way against them, and
keep its charge of life from them;&mdash;does any other soulless
thing do as much as this?</p>

<p>I should not have talked of this feeling of mine about a
boat, if I had thought it was mine only; but I believe it to be
common to all of us who are not seamen. With the seaman,
wonder changes into fellowship and close affection; but to all
landsmen, from youth upwards, the boat remains a piece of
enchantment; at least unless we entangle our vanity in it,
and refine it away into mere lath, giving up all its protective
nobleness for pace. With those in whose eyes the perfection
of a boat is swift fragility, I have no sympathy. The glory
of a boat is, first its steadiness of poise&mdash;its assured standing
on the clear softness of the abyss; and, after that, so much
capacity of progress by oar or sail as shall be consistent with
this defiance of the treachery of the sea. And, this being
understood, it is very notable how commonly the poets, creating
for themselves an ideal of motion, fasten upon the charm
of a boat. They do not usually express any desire for wings,
or, if they do, it is only in some vague and half-unintended
phrase, such as "flit or soar," involving wingedness. Seriously,
they are evidently content to let the wings belong to
Horse, or Muse, or Angel, rather than to themselves; but they
all, somehow or other, express an honest wish for a Spiritual
Boat. I will not dwell on poor Shelley's paper navies, and
seas of quicksilver, lest we should begin to think evil of boats
in general because of that traitorous one in Spezzia Bay; but
it is a triumph to find the pastorally minded Wordsworth
imagine no other way of visiting the stars than in a boat "no
bigger than the crescent moon";<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> and to find Tennyson&mdash;although
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>his boating, in an ordinary way, has a very marshy
and punt-like character&mdash;at last, in his highest inspiration,
enter in where the wind began "to sweep a music out of sheet
and shroud."<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> But the chief triumph of all is in Dante. He
had known all manner of traveling; had been borne through
vacancy on the shoulders of chimeras, and lifted through
upper heaven in the grasp of its spirits; but yet I do not
remember that he ever expresses any positive <i>wish</i> on such
matters, except for a boat.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Guido, I wish that Lapo, thou, and I,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So that no change nor any evil chance<br /></span>

<span class="i2">That even satiety should still enhance<br /></span>

<p class="cont">And of all the descriptions of motion in the <i>Divina Commedia</i>,
I do not think there is another quite so fine as that in
which Dante has glorified the old fable of Charon by giving
a boat also to the bright sea which surrounds the mountain
of Purgatory, bearing the redeemed souls to their place of
trial; only an angel is now the pilot, and there is no stroke of
laboring oar, for his wings are the sails.</p>

</div></div>

<p>I have given this passage at length, because it seems to me
that Dante's most inventive adaptation of the fable of Charon
to Heaven has not been regarded with the interest that it
really deserves; and because, also, it is a description that
should be remembered by every traveler when first he sees
the white fork of the felucca sail shining on the Southern Sea.
Not that Dante had ever seen such sails;<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> his thought was
utterly irrespective of the form of canvas in any ship of the
period; but it is well to be able to attach this happy image to
those felucca sails, as they now float white and soft above the
blue glowing of the bays of Adria. Nor are other images
wanting in them. Seen far away on the horizon, the Neapolitan
felucca has all the aspect of some strange bird stooping
out of the air and just striking the water with its claws; while
the Venetian, when its painted sails are at full swell in
sunshine, is as beautiful as a butterfly with its wings half-closed.<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>
There is something also in them that might remind
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>us of the variegated and spotted angel wings of Orcagna,
only the Venetian sail never looks majestic; it is too quaint
and strange, yet with no peacock's pride or vulgar gayety,&mdash;nothing
of Milton's Dalilah:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So bedecked, ornate and gay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a stately ship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Tarsus, bound for the Isles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Javan or Gadire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all her bravery on and tackle trim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sails filled and streamers waving."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="cont">That description could only have been written in a time of
vulgar women and vulgar vessels. The utmost vanity of dress
in a woman of the fourteenth century would have given no
image of "sails filled or streamers waving"; nor does the
look or action of a really "stately" ship ever suggest any
image of the motion of a weak or vain woman. The beauties
of the Court of Charles II., and the gilded galleys of the
Thames, might fitly be compared; but the pomp of the Venetian
fisher-boat is like neither. The sail seems dyed in its
fullness by the sunshine, as the rainbow dyes a cloud; the
rich stains upon it fade and reappear, as its folds swell or
fall; worn with the Adrian storms, its rough woof has a kind
of noble dimness upon it, and its colors seem as grave, inherent,
and free from vanity as the spots of the leopard, or
veins of the seashell.</p>

<p>Yet, in speaking of poets' love of boats, I ought to have
limited the love to <i>modern</i> poets; Dante, in this respect, as
in nearly every other, being far in advance of his age. It
is not often that I congratulate myself upon the days in which
I happen to live; but I do so in this respect, that, compared
with every other period of the world, this nineteenth century
(or rather, the period between 1750 and 1850) may not improperly
be called the Age of Boats; while the classic and
chivalric times, in which boats were partly dreaded, partly
despised, may respectively be characterized, with regard to
their means of locomotion, as the Age of Chariots, and the
Age of Horses.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p>For, whatever perfection and costliness there may be in
the present decorations, harnessing, and horsing of any English
or Parisian wheel equipage, I apprehend that we can
from none of them form any high ideal of wheel conveyance;
and that unless we had seen an Egyptian king bending his
bow with his horses at the gallop, or a Greek knight leaning
with his poised lance over the shoulder of his charioteer, we
have no right to consider ourselves as thoroughly knowing
what the word "chariot," in its noblest acceptation, means.</p>

<p>So, also, though much chivalry is yet left in us, and we
English still know several things about horses, I believe that
if we had seen Charlemagne and Roland ride out hunting
from Aix, or C&oelig;ur de Lion trot into camp on a sunny evening
at Ascalon, or a Florentine lady canter down the Val
d'Arno in Dante's time, with her hawk on her wrist, we
should have had some other ideas even about horses than the
best we can have now. But most assuredly, nothing that ever
swung at the quay sides of Carthage, or glowed with crusaders'
shields above the bays of Syria, could give to any contemporary
human creature such an idea of the meaning of the
word Boat, as may be now gained by any mortal happy
enough to behold as much as a Newcastle collier beating
against the wind. In the classical period, indeed, there was
some importance given to shipping as the means of locking a
battle-field together on the waves; but in the chivalric period,
the whole mind of man is withdrawn from the sea, regarding
it merely as a treacherous impediment, over which it was
necessary sometimes to find conveyance, but from which the
thoughts were always turned impatiently, fixing themselves
in green fields, and pleasures that may be enjoyed by land&mdash;the
very supremacy of the horse necessitating the scorn of
the sea, which would not be trodden by hoofs.</p>

<p>It is very interesting to note how repugnant every oceanic
idea appears to be to the whole nature of our principal
English medi&aelig;val poet, Chaucer. Read first the Man of
Lawe's Tale, in which the Lady Constance is continually
floated up and down the Mediterranean, and the German
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>Ocean, in a ship by herself; carried from Syria all the way
to Northumberland, and there wrecked upon the coast; thence
yet again driven up and down among the waves for five years,
she and her child; and yet, all this while, Chaucer does not
let fall a single word descriptive of the sea, or express any
emotion whatever about it, or about the ship. He simply
tells us the lady sailed here and was wrecked there; but
neither he nor his audience appear to be capable of receiving
any sensation, but one of simple aversion, from waves, ships,
or sands. Compare with his absolutely apathetic recital, the
description by a modern poet of the sailing of a vessel, charged
with the fate of another Constance:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It curled not Tweed alone, that breeze&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For far upon Northumbrian seas<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It freshly blew, and strong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where from high Whitby's cloistered pile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound to St. Cuthbert's holy isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It bore a bark along.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the gale she stooped her side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bounded o'er the swelling tide<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As she were dancing home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The merry seamen laughed to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their gallant ship so lustily<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Furrow the green sea foam."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now just as Scott enjoys this sea breeze, so does Chaucer
the soft air of the woods; the moment the older poet lands,
he is himself again, his poverty of language in speaking of
the ship is not because he despises description, but because
he has nothing to describe. Hear him upon the ground in
Spring:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"These woodes else recoveren greene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That drie in winter ben to sene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the erth waxeth proud withall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sweet dewes that on it fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the poore estate forget,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which that winter had it set:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then becomes the ground so proude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That it wol have a newe shroude,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span><span class="i0">And maketh so queint his robe and faire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That it had hewes an hundred paire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of grasse and floures, of Inde and Pers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many hewes full divers:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is the robe I mean ywis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through which the ground to praisen is."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In like manner, wherever throughout his poems we find
Chaucer enthusiastic, it is on a sunny day in the "good green-wood,"
but the slightest approach to the sea-shore makes him
shiver; and his antipathy finds at last positive expression, and
becomes the principal foundation of the Frankeleine's Tale,
in which a lady, waiting for her husband's return in a castle
by the sea, behaves and expresses herself as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Another time wold she sit and thinke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cast her eyen dounward fro the brinke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whan she saw the grisly rockes blake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For veray fere so wold hire herte quake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That on hire feet she might hire not sustene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than wold she sit adoun upon the grene,<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>That semen rather a foule confusion</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Of werk, than any faire creation</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of swiche a parfit wise God and stable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why han ye wrought this werk unresonable?'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="cont">The desire to have the rocks out of her way is indeed severely
punished in the sequel of the tale; but it is not the less
characteristic of the age, and well worth meditating upon,
in comparison with the feelings of an unsophisticated modern
French or English girl among the black rocks of Dieppe or
Ramsgate.</p>

<p>On the other hand, much might be said about that peculiar
love of <i>green fields and birds</i> in the Middle Ages; and of all
with which it is connected, purity and health in manners and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>heart, as opposed to the too frequent condition of the modern
mind&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"As for the birds in the thicket,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>But this would lead us far afield, and the main fact I have
to point out to the reader is the transition of human grace and
strength from the exercises of the land to those of the sea in
the course of the last three centuries.</p>

<p>Down to Elizabeth's time chivalry lasted; and grace of
dress and mien, and all else that was connected with chivalry.
Then came the ages which, when they have taken their due
place in the depths of the past, will be, by a wise and clear-sighted
futurity, perhaps well comprehended under a common
name, as the ages of Starch; periods of general stiffening and
bluish-whitening, with a prevailing washerwoman's taste in
everything; involving a change of steel armor into cambric;
of natural hair into peruke; of natural walking into that
which will disarrange no wristbands; of plain language into
quips and embroideries; and of human life in general, from
a green race-course, where to be defeated was at worst only to
fall behind and recover breath, into a slippery pole, to be
climbed with toil and contortion, and in clinging to which,
each man's foot is on his neighbor's head.</p>

<p>But, meanwhile, the marine deities were incorruptible. It
was not possible to starch the sea; and precisely as the stiffness
fastened upon men, it vanished from ships. What had once
been a mere raft, with rows of formal benches, pushed along
by laborious flap of oars, and with infinite fluttering of flags
and swelling of poops above, gradually began to lean more
heavily into the deep water, to sustain a gloomy weight of
guns, to draw back its spider-like feebleness of limb, and
open its bosom to the wind, and finally darkened down from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>all its painted vanities into the long, low hull, familiar with
the overflying foam; that has no other pride but in its daily
duty and victory; while, through all these changes, it gained
continually in grace, strength, audacity, and beauty, until
at last it has reached such a pitch of all these, that there is
not, except the very loveliest creatures of the living world,
anything in nature so absolutely notable, bewitching, and,
according to its means and measure, heart-occupying, as a
well-handled ship under sail in a stormy day. Any ship,
from lowest to proudest, has due place in that architecture
of the sea; beautiful, not so much in this or that piece
of it, as in the unity of all, from cottage to cathedral, into
their great buoyant dynasty. Yet, among them, the fisher-boat,
corresponding to the cottage on the land (only far more
sublime than a cottage ever can be), is on the whole the thing
most venerable. I doubt if ever academic grove were half
so fit for profitable meditation as the little strip of shingle
between two black, steep, overhanging sides of stranded fishing-boats.
The clear, heavy water-edge of ocean rising and
falling close to their bows, in that unaccountable way which
the sea has always in calm weather, turning the pebbles over
and over as if with a rake, to look for something, and then
stopping a moment down at the bottom of the bank, and coming
up again with a little run and clash, throwing a foot's
depth of salt crystal in an instant between you and the round
stone you were going to take in your hand; sighing, all the
while, as if it would infinitely rather be doing something else.
And the dark flanks of the fishing-boats all aslope above, in
their shining quietness, hot in the morning sun, rusty and
seamed with square patches of plank nailed over their rents;
just rough enough to let the little flat-footed fisher-children
haul or twist themselves up to the gunwales, and drop back
again along some stray rope; just round enough to remind us,
in their broad and gradual curves, of the sweep of the green
surges they know so well, and of the hours when those old
sides of seared timber, all ashine with the sea, plunge and
dip into the deep green purity of the mounded waves more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>joyfully than a deer lies down among the grass of spring, the
soft white cloud of foam opening momentarily at the bows,
and fading or flying high into the breeze where the sea-gulls
toss and shriek,&mdash;the joy and beauty of it, all the while, so
mingled with the sense of unfathomable danger, and the
human effort and sorrow going on perpetually from age to
age, waves rolling forever, and winds moaning forever, and
faithful hearts trusting and sickening forever, and brave lives
dashed away about the rattling beach like weeds forever;
and still at the helm of every lonely boat, through starless
night and hopeless dawn, His hand, who spread the fisher's
net over the dust of the Sidonian palaces, and gave into the
fisher's hand the keys of the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>Next after the fishing-boat&mdash;which, as I said, in the architecture
of the sea represents the cottage, more especially the
pastoral or agricultural cottage, watchful over some pathless
domain of moorland or arable, as the fishing-boat swims,
humbly in the midst of the broad green fields and hills of
ocean, out of which it has to win such fruit as they can give,
and to compass with net or drag such flocks as it may find,&mdash;next
to this ocean-cottage ranks in interest, it seems to me,
the small, over-wrought, under-crewed, ill-caulked merchant
brig or schooner; the kind of ship which first shows its couple
of thin masts over the low fields or marshes as we near any
third-rate sea-port; and which is sure somewhere to stud the
great space of glittering water, seen from any sea-cliff, with
its four or five square-set sails. Of the larger and more
polite tribes of merchant vessels, three-masted, and passenger-carrying,
I have nothing to say, feeling in general little
sympathy with people who want to <i>go</i> anywhere; nor caring
much about anything, which in the essence of it expresses a
desire to get to other sides of the world; but only for homely
and stay-at-home ships, that live their life and die their death
about English rocks. Neither have I any interest in the
higher branches of commerce, such as traffic with spice
islands, and porterage of painted tea-chests or carved ivory;
for all this seems to me to fall under the head of commerce
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>of the drawing-room; costly, but not venerable. I respect in
the merchant service only those ships that carry coals, herrings,
salt, timber, iron, and such other commodities, and that
have disagreeable odor, and unwashed decks. But there are
few things more impressive to me than one of these ships
lying up against some lonely quay in a black sea-fog, with
the furrow traced under its tawny keel far in the harbor slime.
The noble misery that there is in it, the might of its rent and
strained unseemliness, its wave-worn melancholy, resting there
for a little while in the comfortless ebb, unpitied, and claiming
no pity; still less honored, least of all conscious of any
claim to honor; casting and craning by due balance whatever
is in its hold up to the pier, in quiet truth of time; spinning
of wheel, and slackening of rope, and swinging of spade, in
as accurate cadence as a waltz music; one or two of its crew,
perhaps, away forward, and a hungry boy and yelping dog
eagerly interested in something from which a blue dull
smoke rises out of pot or pan; but dark-browed and silent,
their limbs slack, like the ropes above them, entangled as
they are in those inextricable meshes about the patched
knots and heaps of ill-reefed sable sail. What a majestic
sense of service in all that languor! the rest of human limbs
and hearts, at utter need, not in sweet meadows or soft air,
but in harbor slime and biting fog; so drawing their breath
once more, to go out again, without lament, from between the
two skeletons of pier-heads, vocal with wash of under wave,
into the gray troughs of tumbling brine; there, as they can,
with slacked rope, and patched sail, and leaky hull, again to
roll and stagger far away amidst the wind and salt sleet,
from dawn to dusk and dusk to dawn, winning day by day
their daily bread; and for last reward, when their old hands,
on some winter night, lose feeling along the frozen ropes,
and their old eyes miss mark of the lighthouse quenched in
foam, the so-long impossible Rest, that shall hunger no more,
neither thirst any more,&mdash;their eyes and mouths filled with
the brown sea-sand.</p>

<p>After these most venerable, to my mind, of all ships, properly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>so styled, I find nothing of comparable interest in any
floating fabric until we come to the great achievement of the
19th century. For one thing this century will in after ages
be considered to have done in a superb manner, and one thing,
I think, only. It has not distinguished itself in political
spheres; still less in artistical. It has produced no golden age
by its Reason; neither does it appear eminent for the constancy
of its Faith. Its telescopes and telegraphs would be
creditable to it, if it had not in their pursuit forgotten in
great part how to see clearly with its eyes, and to talk honestly
with its tongue. Its natural history might have been creditable
to it also, if it could have conquered its habit of considering
natural history to be mainly the art of writing Latin
names on white tickets. But, as it is, none of these things will
be hereafter considered to have been got on with by us as well
as might be; whereas it will always be said of us, with unabated
reverence,</p>

<p class="center smcap lc">"THEY BUILT SHIPS OF THE LINE."</p>

<p>Take it all in all, a Ship of the Line is the most honorable
thing that man, as a gregarious animal, has ever produced.
By himself, unhelped, he can do better things than ships
of the line; he can make poems and pictures, and other such
concentrations of what is best in him. But as a being living
in flocks, and hammering out, with alternate strokes and
mutual agreement, what is necessary for him in those flocks,
to get or produce, the ship of the line is his first work. Into
that he has put as much of his human patience, common
sense, forethought, experimental philosophy, self-control,
habits of order and obedience, thoroughly wrought handwork,
defiance of brute elements, careless courage, careful patriotism,
and calm expectation of the judgment of God, as can well
be put into a space of 300 feet long by 80 broad. And I am
thankful to have lived in an age when I could see this thing
so done.</p>

<p>Considering, then, our shipping, under the three principal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>types of fishing-boat, collier, and ship of the line, as the great
glory of this age; and the "New Forest" of mast and yard
that follows the windings of the Thames, to be, take it all
in all, a more majestic scene, I don't say merely than any of
our streets or palaces as they now are, but even than the best
that streets and palaces can generally be; it has often been a
matter of serious thought to me how far this chiefly substantial
thing done by the nation ought to be represented by
the art of the nation; how far our great artists ought seriously
to devote themselves to such perfect painting of our ships as
should reveal to later generations&mdash;lost perhaps in clouds of
steam and floating troughs of ashes&mdash;the aspect of an ancient
ship of battle under sail.</p>

<p>To which, I fear, the answer must be sternly this: That
no great art ever was, or can be, employed in the careful
imitation of the work of man as its principal subject. That
is to say, art will not bear to be reduplicated. A ship is a
noble thing, and a cathedral a noble thing, but a painted ship
or a painted cathedral is not a noble thing. Art which reduplicates
art is necessarily second-rate art. I know no principle
more irrefragably authoritative than that which I had long
ago occasion to express: "All noble art is the expression of
man's delight in God's work; not in his own."</p>

<p>"How!" it will be asked, "Are Stanfield, Isabey, and
Prout necessarily artists of the second order because they
paint ships and buildings instead of trees and clouds?" Yes,
necessarily of the second order; so far as they paint ships
rather than sea, and so far as they paint buildings rather
than the natural light, and color, and work of years upon those
buildings. For, in this respect, a ruined building is a noble
subject, just as far as man's work has therein been subdued
by nature's; and Stanfield's chief dignity is his being a
painter less of shipping than of the seal of time or decay
upon shipping.<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> For a wrecked ship, or shattered boat, is
a noble subject, while a ship in full sail, or a perfect boat, is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>an ignoble one; not merely because the one is by reason of its
ruin more picturesque than the other, but because it is a
nobler act in man to meditate upon Fate as it conquers his
work, than upon that work itself.</p>

<p>Shipping, therefore, in its perfection, never can become the
subject of noble art; and that just because to represent it in
its perfection would tax the powers of art to the utmost. If
a great painter could rest in drawing a ship, as he can rest in
drawing a piece of drapery, we might sometimes see vessels
introduced by the noblest workmen, and treated by them with
as much delight as they would show in scattering luster over
an embroidered dress, or knitting the links of a coat of mail.
But ships cannot be drawn at times of rest. More complicated
in their anatomy than the human frame itself, so far
as that frame is outwardly discernible; liable to all kinds of
strange accidental variety in position and movement, yet in
each position subject to imperative laws which can only be
followed by unerring knowledge; and involving, in the roundings
and foldings of sail and hull, delicacies of drawing
greater than exist in any other inorganic object, except perhaps
a snow wreath,<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a>&mdash;they present, irrespective of sea or
sky, or anything else around them, difficulties which could
only be vanquished by draughtsmanship quite accomplished
enough to render even the subtlest lines of the human face
and form. But the artist who has once attained such skill
as this will not devote it to the drawing of ships. He who
can paint the face of St. Paul will not elaborate the parting
timbers of the vessel in which he is wrecked; and he who can
represent the astonishment of the apostles at the miraculous
draught will not be solicitous about accurately showing that
their boat is overloaded.</p>

<p>"What!" it will perhaps be replied, "have, then, ships
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>never been painted perfectly yet, even by the men who have
devoted most attention to them?" Assuredly not. A ship
never yet has been painted at all, in any other sense than men
have been painted in "Landscapes with figures." Things
have been painted which have a general effect of ships, just
as things have been painted which have a general effect of
shepherds or banditti; but the best average ship-painting no
more reaches the truth of ships than the equestrian troops in
one of Van der Meulen's battle-pieces express the higher
truths of humanity.</p>

<p>Take a single instance. I do not know any work in which,
on the whole, there is a more unaffected love of ships for their
own sake, and a fresher feeling of sea breeze always blowing,
than Stanfield's "Coast Scenery." Now, let the reader take
up that book, and look through all the plates of it at the way
in which the most important parts of a ship's skeleton are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>drawn, those most wonderful junctions of mast with mast,
corresponding to the knee or hip in the human frame, technically
known as "Tops." Under its very simplest form, in
one of those poor collier brigs, which I have above endeavored
to recommend to the readers affection, the junction of the
top-gallant-mast with the topmast, when the sail is reefed,
will present itself under no less complex and mysterious form
than this in Fig. 1, a horned knot of seven separate pieces of
timber, irrespective of the two masts and the yard; the whole
balanced and involved in an apparently inextricable web of
chain and rope, consisting of at least sixteen ropes about the
top-gallant-mast, and some twenty-five crossing each other
in every imaginable degree of slackness and slope about the
topmast. Two-thirds of these ropes are omitted in the cut,
because I could not draw them without taking more time and
pains than the point to be illustrated was worth; the thing,
as it is, being drawn quite well enough to give some idea of
the facts of it. Well, take up Stanfield's "Coast Scenery,"
and look through it in search of tops, and you will invariably
find them represented as in Fig. 2, or even with fewer lines;
the example Fig. 2 being one of the tops of the frigate running
into Portsmouth harbor, magnified to about twice its
size in the plate.</p>

<p>"Well, but it was impossible to do more on so small a
scale." By no means: but take what scale you choose, of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>Stanfield's or any other marine painter's most elaborate painting,
and let me magnify the study of the real top in proportion,
and the deficiency of detail will always be found
equally great: I mean in the work of the higher artists, for
there are of course many efforts at greater accuracy of
delineation by those painters of ships who are to the higher
marine painter what botanical draughtsmen are to the landscapists;
but just as in the botanical engraving the spirit and
life of the plant are always lost, so in the technical ship-painting
the life of the ship is always lost, without, as far as
I can see, attaining, even by this sacrifice, anything like
completeness of mechanical delineation. At least, I never
saw the ship drawn yet which gave me the slightest idea of
the entanglement of real rigging.</p>

<p>Respecting this lower kind of ship-painting, it is always
matter of wonder to me that it satisfies sailors. Some years
ago I happened to stand longer than pleased my pensioner
guide before Turner's "Battle of Trafalgar," at Greenwich
Hospital; a picture which, at a moderate estimate, is simply
worth all the rest of the hospital&mdash;ground&mdash;walls&mdash;pictures
and models put together. My guide, supposing me to be
detained by indignant wonder at seeing it in so good a place,
assented to my supposed, sentiments by muttering in a low
voice: "Well, sir, it <i>is</i> a shame that that thing should be there.
We ought to 'a 'ad a Uggins; that's sartain." I was not surprised
that my sailor friend should be disgusted at seeing the
<i>Victory</i> lifted nearly right out of the water, and all the sails
of the fleet blowing about to that extent that the crews might
as well have tried to reef as many thunder-clouds. But I
was surprised at his perfect repose of respectful faith in
"Uggins," who appeared to me&mdash;unfortunate landsman as
I was&mdash;to give no more idea of the look of a ship of the line
going through the sea, than might be obtained from seeing
one of the correct models at the top of the hall floated in a
fishpond.</p>

<p>Leaving, however, the sailor to his enjoyment, on such
grounds as it may be, of this model drawing, and being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>prepared to find only a vague and hasty shadowing forth of
shipping in the works of artists proper, we will glance briefly
at the different stages of excellence which such shadowing
forth has reached, and note in their consecutive changes the
feelings with which shipping has been regarded at different
periods of art.</p>

<p>1. <i>Medi&aelig;val Period.</i> The vessel is regarded merely as a
sort of sea-carriage, and painted only so far as it is necessary
for complete display of the groups of soldiers or saints on
the deck: a great deal of quaint shipping, richly hung with
shields, and gorgeous with banners, is, however, thus incidently
represented in 15th-century manuscripts, embedded
in curly green waves of sea full of long fish; and although
there is never the slightest expression of real sea character,
of motion, gloom, or spray, there is more real interest of
marine detail and incident than in many later compositions.</p>

<p>2. <i>Early Venetian Period.</i> A great deal of tolerably careful
boat-drawing occurs in the pictures of Carpaccio and
Gentile Bellini, deserving separate mention among the marine
schools, in confirmation of what has been stated above, that
the drawing of boats is more difficult than that of the human
form. For, long after all the perspectives and fore-shortenings
of the human body were completely understood, as well
as those of architecture, it remained utterly beyond the power
of the artists of the time to draw a boat with even tolerable
truth. Boats are always tilted up on end, or too long, or too
short, or too high in the water. Generally they appear to
be regarded with no interest whatever, and are painted merely
where they are matters of necessity. This is perfectly natural:
we pronounce that there is romance in the Venetian
conveyance by oars, merely because we ourselves are in the
habit of being dragged by horses. A Venetian, on the other
hand, sees vulgarity in a gondola, and thinks the only true
romance is in a hackney coach. And thus, it was no more
likely that a painter in the days of Venetian power should
pay much attention to the shipping in the Grand Canal than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>that an English artist should at present concentrate the
brightest rays of his genius on a cab-stand.</p>

<p>3. <i>Late Venetian Period.</i> Deserving mention only for its
notably negative character. None of the great Venetian
painters, Tintoret, Titian, Veronese, Bellini, Giorgione,
Bonifazio, ever introduce a ship if they can help it. They
delight in ponderous architecture, in grass, flowers, blue
mountains, skies, clouds, and gay dresses; nothing comes
amiss to them but ships and the sea. When they are forced
to introduce these, they represent merely a dark-green plain,
with reddish galleys spotted about it here and there, looking
much like small models of shipping pinned on a green board.
In their marine battles, there is seldom anything discernible
except long rows of scarlet oars, and men in armor falling
helplessly through them.</p>

<p>4. <i>Late Roman Period.</i> That is to say, the time of the
beginning of the Renaissance landscape by the Caracci,
Claude, and Salvator. First, in their landscapes, shipping
begins to assume something like independent character, and
to be introduced for the sake of its picturesque interest;
although what interest could be taken by any healthy human
creature in such vessels as were then painted has always
remained a mystery to me. The ships of Claude, having hulls
of a shape something between a cocoa-nut and a high-heeled
shoe, balanced on their keels on the top of the water, with
some scaffolding and cross-sticks above, and a flag at the top
of every stick, form perhaps the <i>purest</i> exhibition of human
inanity and fatuity which the arts have yet produced. The
harbors also, in which these model navies ride, are worthy
of all observation for the intensity of the false taste which,
endeavoring to unite in them the characters of pleasure-ground
and port, destroys the veracity of both. There are
many inlets of the Italian seas where sweet gardens and
regular terraces descend to the water's edge; but these are
not the spots where merchant vessels anchor, or where bales
are disembarked. On the other hand, there are many busy
quays and noisy arsenals upon the shores of Italy; but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>Queen's palaces are not built upon the quays, nor are the
docks in any wise adorned with conservatories or ruins. It
was reserved for the genius of Claude to combine the luxurious
with the lucrative, and rise to a commercial ideal, in
which cables are fastened to temple pillars, and lighthouses
adorned with rows of beaupots. It seems strange also that
any power which Salvator showed in the treatment of other
subjects utterly deserts him when he approaches the sea.
Though always coarse, false, and vulgar, he has at least
energy, and some degree of invention, as long as he remains
on land; his terrestrial atrocities are animated, and his rock-born
fancies formidable. But the sea air seems to dim his
sight and paralyze his hand. His love of darkness and destruction,
far from seeking sympathy in the rage of ocean,
disappears as he approaches the beach; after having tortured
the innocence of trees into demoniac convulsions, and shattered
the loveliness of purple hills into colorless dislocation,
he approaches the real wrath and restlessness of ocean without
either admiration or dismay, and appears to feel nothing at
its shore except a meager interest in bathers, fishermen, and
gentlemen in court dress bargaining for state cabins. Of all
the pictures by men who bear the reputation of great masters
which I have ever seen in my life (except only some by
Domenichino), the two large "Marines" in the Pitti Palace,
attributed to Salvator, are, on the whole, the most vapid and
vile examples of human want of understanding. In the folly
of Claude there is still a gleam of grace and innocence; there
is refreshment in his childishness, and tenderness in his
inability. But the folly of Salvator is disgusting in its very
nothingness: it is like the vacuity of a plague-room in an
hospital, shut up in uncleansed silence, emptied of pain and
motion, but not of infection.</p>

<p>5. <i>Dutch Period.</i> Although in artistical qualities lower
than is easily by language expressible, the Italian marine
painting usually conveys an idea of three facts about the sea,&mdash;that
it is green, that it is deep, and that the sun shines on
it. The dark plain which stands for far away Adriatic with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>the Venetians, and the glinting swells of tamed wave which
lap about the quays of Claude, agree in giving the general
impression that the ocean consists of pure water, and is open
to the pure sky. But the Dutch painters, while they attain
considerably greater dexterity than the Italian in mere delineation
of nautical incident, were by nature precluded from
ever becoming aware of these common facts; and having, in
reality, never in all their lives seen the sea, but only a shallow
mixture of sea-water and sand; and also never in all their
lives seen the sky, but only a lower element between them and
it, composed of marsh exhalation and fog-bank; they are not
to be with too great severity reproached for the dullness of
their records of the nautical enterprise of Holland. <i>We</i> only
are to be reproached, who, familiar with the Atlantic, are yet
ready to accept with faith, as types of sea, the small waves
<i>en papillote</i>, and peruke-like puffs of farinaceous foam, which
were the delight of Backhuysen and his compeers. If one
could but arrest the connoisseurs in the fact of looking at
them with belief, and, magically introducing the image of a
true sea-wave, let it roll up to them through the room,&mdash;one
massive fathom's height and rood's breadth of brine, passing
them by but once,&mdash;dividing, Red Sea-like, on right hand
and left,&mdash;but at least setting close before their eyes, for
once in inevitable truth, what a sea-wave really is; its green
mountainous giddiness of wrath, its overwhelming crest&mdash;heavy
as iron, fitful as flame, clashing against the sky in long
cloven edge,&mdash;its furrowed flanks, all ghastly clear, deep in
transparent death, but all laced across with lurid nets of
spume, and tearing open into meshed interstices their churned
veil of silver fury, showing still the calm gray abyss below;
that has no fury and no voice, but is as a grave always open,
which the green sighing mounds do but hide for an instant as
they pass. Would they, shuddering back from this wave of
the true, implacable sea, turn forthwith to the papillotes?
It might be so. It is what we are all doing, more or less,
continually.</p>

<p>Well, let the waves go their way; it is not of them that we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>have here to reason; but be it remembered, that men who
cannot enter into the Mind of the Sea, cannot for the same
reason enter into the Mind of Ships, in their contention with
it; and the fluttering, tottering, high-pooped, flag-beset fleets
of these Dutch painters have only this much superiority over
the caricatures of the Italians, that they indeed appear in
some degree to have been studied from the high-pooped and
flag-beset nature which was in that age visible, while the
Claude and Salvator ships are ideals of the studio. But the
effort is wholly unsuccessful. Any one who has ever attempted
to sketch a vessel in motion knows that he might as easily
attempt to sketch a bird on the wing, or a trout on the dart.
Ships can only be drawn, as animals must be, by the high instinct
of momentary perception, which rarely developed itself
in any Dutch painter, and least of all in their painters of
marine. And thus the awkward forms of shipping, the shallow
impurity of the sea, and the cold incapacity of the painter,
joining in disadvantageous influence over them, the Dutch
marine paintings may be simply, but circumstantially, described
as the misrepresentation of undeveloped shipping in
a discolored sea by distempered painters. An exception
ought to be made in favor of the boats of Cuyp, which are
generally well floated in calm and sunny water; and, though
rather punts or tubs than boats, have in them some elements
of a slow, warm, square-sailed, sleepy grandeur&mdash;respectable
always, when compared either with the flickering follies of
Backhuysen, or the monstrous, unmanly, and <i>&agrave; fortiori</i>,
unsailorly absurdities of metaphysical vessels, puffed on their
way by corpulent genii, or pushed by protuberant dolphins,
which Rubens and the other so-called historical painters of
his time were accustomed to introduce in the mythology of
their court-adulation; that marvelous Faith of the 18th
century, which will one day, and that not far off, be known
for a thing more truly disgraceful to human nature than the
Polynesian's dance round his feather idol, or Egyptian's
worship of the food he fattened on. From Salvator and
Domenichino it is possible to turn in a proud indignation,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>knowing that theirs are no fair examples of the human mind;
but it is with humbled and woful anger that we must trace
the degradation of the intellect of Rubens in his pictures of
the life of Mary of Medicis.<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a></p>

<p>6. <i>Modern Period.</i> The gradual appreciation of the true
character both of shipping and the ocean, in the works of the
painters of the last half century, is part of that successful
study of other elements of landscape, of which I have long
labored at a consistent investigation, now partly laid before
the public; I shall not, therefore, here enter into any general
inquiry respecting modern sea-painting, but limit myself to
a notice of the particular feelings which influenced Turner in
his marine studies, so far as they are shown in the series of
plates which have now been trusted to me for illustration.</p>

<p>Among the earliest sketches from nature which Turner
appears to have made, in pencil and Indian ink, when a boy
of twelve or fourteen, it is very singular how large a proportion
consists of careful studies of stranded boats. Now,
after some fifteen years of conscientious labor, with the
single view of acquiring knowledge of the ends and powers
of art, I have come to one conclusion, which at the beginning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>of those fifteen years would have been very astonishing to
myself&mdash;that, of all our modern school of landscape painters,
next to Turner, and before the rise of the Pre-Raphaelites,
the man whose works are on the whole most valuable, and
show the highest intellect, is Samuel Prout. It is very
notable that also in Prout's early studies, shipping subjects
took not merely a prominent, but I think even a principal,
place.</p>

<p>The reason of this is very evident: both Turner and Prout
had in them an untaught, inherent perception of what was
great and pictorial. They could not find it in the buildings
or in the scenes immediately around them. But they saw
some element of real power in the boats. Prout afterwards
found material suited to his genius in other directions, and
left his first love; but Turner retained the early affection to
the close of his life, and the last oil picture which he painted,
before his noble hand forgot its cunning, was the Wreck-buoy.
The last thoroughly perfect picture he ever painted,
was the Old T&eacute;m&eacute;raire.</p>

<p>The studies which he was able to make from nature in
his early years, are chiefly of fishing-boats, barges, and other
minor marine still life; and his better acquaintance with this
kind of shipping than with the larger kind is very marked
in the Liber Studiorum, in which there are five careful
studies of fishing-boats under various circumstances; namely,
Calais Harbor, Sir John Mildmay's Picture, Flint Castle,
Marine Dabblers, and the Calm; while of other shipping,
there are only two subjects, both exceedingly unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Turner, however, deemed it necessary to his reputation at
that period that he should paint pictures in the style of Vandevelde;
and, in order to render the resemblance more
complete, he appears to have made careful drawings of the
different parts of old Dutch shipping. I found a large
number of such drawings among the contents of his neglected
portfolios at his death; some were clearly not by his own hand,
others appeared to be transcripts by him from prints or
earlier drawings; the quantity altogether was very great, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>the evidence of his prolonged attention to the subject more
distinct than with respect to any other element of landscape.
Of plants, rocks, or architecture, there were very few careful
pieces of anatomical study. But several drawers were
entirely filled with these memoranda of shipping.</p>

<p>In executing the series of drawings for the work known
as the Southern Coast, Turner appears to have gained many
ideas about shipping, which, once received, he laid up by
him for use in after years. The evidence of this laying by
of thought in his mind, as it were in reserve, until he had
power to express it, is curious and complete throughout his
life; and although the Southern Coast drawings are for the
most part quiet in feeling, and remarkably simple in their
mode of execution, I believe it was in the watch over the
Cornish and Dorsetshire coast, which the making of those
drawings involved, that he received all his noblest ideas
about sea and ships.</p>

<p>Of one thing I am certain; Turner never drew anything
that could be <i>seen</i>, without having seen it. That is to say,
though he would draw Jerusalem from some one else's
sketch, it would be, nevertheless, entirely from his own
experience of ruined walls: and though he would draw
ancient shipping (for an imitation of Vandevelde, or a
vignette to the voyage of Columbus) from such data as he
could get about things which he could no more see with his
own eyes, yet when, of his own free will, in the subject of
Ilfracombe, he, in the year 1818, introduces a shipwreck, I
am perfectly certain that, before the year 1818, he had <i>seen</i>
a shipwreck, and, moreover, one of that horrible kind&mdash;a
ship dashed to pieces in deep water, at the foot of an inaccessible
cliff. Having once seen this, I perceive, also, that
the image of it could not be effaced from his mind. It
taught him two great facts, which he never afterwards forgot;
namely, that both ships and sea were things that broke to
pieces. <i>He never afterwards painted a ship quite in fair
order.</i> There is invariably a feeling about his vessels of
strange awe and danger; the sails are in some way loosening,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>or flapping as if in fear; the swing of the hull, majestic as
it may be, seems more at the mercy of the sea than in triumph
over it; the ship never looks gay, never proud, only warlike
and enduring. The motto he chose, in the Catalogue of the
Academy, for the most cheerful marine he ever painted, the
Sun of Venice going to Sea, marked the uppermost feeling
in his mind:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nor heeds the Demon that in grim repose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Expects his evening prey."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="cont">I notice above the subject of his last marine picture, the
Wreck-buoy, and I am well persuaded that from that year
1818, when first he saw a ship rent asunder, he never beheld
one at sea, without, in his mind's eye, at the same instant,
seeing her skeleton.</p>

<p>But he had seen more than the death of the ship. He had
seen the sea feed her white flames on souls of men; and heard
what a storm-gust sounded like, that had taken up with it,
in its swirl of a moment, the last breaths of a ship's crew.
He never forgot either the sight or the sound. Among the
last plates prepared by his own hand for the Liber Studiorum,
(all of them, as was likely from his advanced knowledge,
finer than any previous pieces of the series, and most of them
unfortunately never published, being retained beside him
for some last touch&mdash;forever delayed,) perhaps the most
important is one of the body of a drowned sailor, dashed
against a vertical rock in the jaws of one merciless, immeasurable
wave. He repeated the same idea, though more feebly
expressed, later in life, in a small drawing of Grandville,
on the coast of France. The sailor clinging to the boat in
the marvelous drawing of Dunbar is another reminiscence of
the same kind. He hardly ever painted a steep rocky coast
without some fragment of a devoured ship, grinding in the
blanched teeth of the surges,&mdash;just enough left to be a token
of utter destruction. Of his two most important paintings
of definite shipwreck I shall speak presently.</p>

<p>I said that at this period he first was assured of another
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>fact, namely, that the <i>Sea</i> also was a thing that broke to
pieces. The sea up to that time had been generally regarded
by painters as a liquidly composed, level-seeking consistent
thing, with a smooth surface, rising to a water-mark on sides
of ships; in which ships were scientifically to be embedded,
and wetted, up to said water-mark, and to remain dry
above the same. But Turner found during his Southern
Coast tour that the sea was <i>not</i> this: that it was, on the contrary,
a very incalculable and unhorizontal thing, setting its
"water mark" sometimes on the highest heavens, as well
as on sides of ships;&mdash;very breakable into pieces; half of
a wave separable from the other half, and on the instant
carriageable miles inland;&mdash;not in any wise limiting itself
to a state of apparent liquidity, but now striking like a steel
gauntlet, and now becoming a cloud, and vanishing, no eye
could tell whither; one moment a flint cave, the next a
marble pillar, the next a mere white fleece thickening the
thundery rain. He never forgot those facts; never afterwards
was able to recover the idea of positive distinction between
sea and sky, or sea and land. Steel gauntlet, black rock,
white cloud, and men and masts gnashed to pieces and disappearing
in a few breaths and splinters among them;&mdash;a little
blood on the rock angle, like red sea-weed, sponged away by
the next splash of the foam, and the glistering granite and
green water all pure again in vacant wrath. So stayed by
him, forever, the Image of the Sea.</p>

<p>One effect of this revelation of the nature of ocean to him
was not a little singular. It seemed that ever afterwards his
appreciation of the calmness of water was deepened by what
he had witnessed of its frenzy, and a certain class of entirely
tame subjects were treated by him even with increased affection
after he had seen the full manifestation of sublimity.
He had always a great regard for canal boats, and instead of
sacrificing these old, and one would have thought unentertaining,
friends to the deities of Storm, he seems to have returned
with a lulling pleasure from the foam and danger of the
beach to the sedgy bank and stealthy barge of the lowland
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>river. Thenceforward his work which introduces shipping
is divided into two classes; one embodying the poetry of
silence and calmness, the other of turbulence and wrath. Of
intermediate conditions he gives few examples; if he lets the
wind down upon the sea at all, it is nearly always violent,
and though the waves may not be running high, the foam is
torn off them in a way which shows they will soon run higher.
On the other hand, nothing is so perfectly calm as Turner's
calmness. To the canal barges of England he soon added
other types of languid motion; the broad-ruddered barks
of the Loire, the drooping sails of Seine, the arcaded barks
of the Italian lakes slumbering on expanse of mountain-guarded
wave, the dreamy prows of pausing gondolas on
lagoons at moon-rise; in each and all commanding an intensity
of calm, chiefly because he never admitted an instant's rigidity.
The surface of quiet water with other painters becomes
<span class="smcap">{lt}FIXED</span>. With Turner it looks as if a fairy's breath would
stir it, but the fairy's breath is not there. So also his boats
are intensely motionless, because intensely capable of motion.
No other painter ever floated a boat quite rightly; all other
boats stand on the water, or are fastened in it; only his <i>float</i>
in it. It is very difficult to trace the reasons of this, for the
rightness of the placing on the water depends on such subtle
curves and shadows in the floating object and its reflection,
that in most cases the question of entirely right or entirely
wrong resolves itself into the "estimation of an hair": and
what makes the matter more difficult still, is, that sometimes
we may see a boat drawn with the most studied correctness in
every part, which yet will not swim; and sometimes we may
find one drawn with many easily ascertainable errors, which
yet swims well enough; so that the drawing of boats is something
like the building of them, one may set off their lines
by the most authentic rules, and yet never be sure they will
sail well. It is, however, to be observed that Turner seemed,
in those southern coast storms, to have been somewhat too
strongly impressed by the disappearance of smaller crafts
in surf, and was wont afterwards to give an uncomfortable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>aspect even to his gentlest seas, by burying his boats too
deeply. When he erred, in this or other matters, it was not
from want of pains, for of all accessories to landscape, ships
were throughout his life those which he studied with the
greatest care. His figures, whatever their merit or demerit,
are certainly never the beloved part of his work; and though
the architecture was in his early drawings careful, and continued
to be so down to the Hakewell's Italy series, it soon
became mannered and false whenever it was principal. He
would indeed draw a ruined tower, or a distant town, incomparably
better than any one else, and a staircase or a bit of
balustrade very carefully; but his temples and cathedrals
showed great ignorance of detail, and want of understanding
of their character. But I am aware of no painting from the
beginning of his life to its close, containing <i>modern</i> shipping
as its principal subject, in which he did not put forth his
full strength, and pour out his knowledge of detail with a
joy which renders those works, as a series, among the most
valuable he ever produced. Take for instance:</p>

<ol><li>Lord Yarborough's Shipwreck.</li>
<li>The Trafalgar, at Greenwich Hospital.</li>
<li>The Trafalgar, in his own gallery.</li>
<li>The Pas de Calais.</li>
<li>The Large Cologne.</li>
<li>The Havre.</li>
<li>The Old T&eacute;m&eacute;raire.</li>
</ol>

<p>I know no fourteen pictures by Turner for which these
seven might be wisely changed; and in all of these the shipping
is thoroughly principal, and studied from existing ships.
A large number of inferior works were, however, also
produced by him in imitation of Vandevelde, representing
old Dutch shipping; in these the shipping is scattered,
scudding and distant, the sea gray and lightly broken. Such
pictures are, generally speaking, among those of least value
which he has produced. Two very important ones, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>belong to the imitative school: Lord Ellesmere's, founded on
Vandevelde; and the Dort, at Farnley, on Cuyp. The latter,
as founded on the better master, is the better picture, but still
possesses few of the true Turner qualities, except his peculiar
calmness, in which respect it is unrivaled; and if joined with
Lord Yarborough's Shipwreck, the two may be considered as
the principal symbols, in Turner's early oil paintings, of his
two strengths in Terror and Repose. Among his drawings,
shipping, as the principal subject, does not always constitute
a work of the first class; nor does it so often occur. For the
difficulty, in a drawing, of getting good color is so much less,
and that of getting good form so much greater, than in oil,
that Turner naturally threw his elaborate studies of ship
form into oil, and made his noblest work in drawing rich in
hues of landscape. Yet the Cowes, Devonport, and Gosport,
from the England and Wales (the Saltash is an inferior
work), united with two drawings of this series, Portsmouth
and Sheerness, and two from Farnley, one of the wreck of
an Indiaman, and the other of a ship of the line taking
stores, would form a series, not indeed as attractive at first
sight as many others, but embracing perhaps more of Turner's
peculiar, unexampled, and unapproachable gifts than any
other group of drawings which could be selected, the choice
being confined to one class of subject.</p>

<p>I have only to state, in conclusion, that these twelve drawings
of the Harbors of England are more representable by
engraving than most of his works. Few parts of them are
brilliant in color; they were executed chiefly in brown and
blue, and with more direct reference to the future engraving
than was common with Turner. They are also small in size,
generally of the exact dimensions of the plate, and therefore
the lines of the compositions are not spoiled by contraction;
while finally, the touch of the painter's hand upon the wave-surface
is far better imitated by mezzotint engraving than
by any of the ordinary expedients of line. Take them all in
all, they form the most valuable series of marine studies
which have as yet been published from his works; and I hope
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>that they may be of some use hereafter in recalling the ordinary
aspect of our English seas, at the exact period when the
nation had done its utmost in the wooden and woven strength
of ships, and had most perfectly fulfilled the old and noble
prophecy&mdash;</p>

<a href="images/illus-dover.jpg"><img src="images/illus-dover-tn.jpg" width="400" height="261" alt="Dover." title="" /></a>
</div></div>


<p>This port has some right to take precedence of others,
as being that assuredly which first exercises the hospitality
of England to the majority of strangers who set foot on her
shores. I place it first therefore among our present subjects;
though the drawing itself, and chiefly on account of its
manifestation of Turner's faulty habit of local exaggeration,
deserves no such pre-eminence. He always painted, not the
place itself, but his impression of it, and this on steady
principle; leaving to inferior artists the task of topographical
detail; and he was right in this principle, as I have shown
elsewhere, when the impression was a genuine one; but in
the present case it is not so. He has lost the real character of
Dover Cliffs by making the town at their feet three times
lower in proportionate height than it really is; nor is he to
be justified in giving the barracks, which appear on the left
hand, more the air of a hospice on the top of an Alpine
precipice, than of an establishment which, out of Snargate
street, can be reached, without drawing breath, by a winding
stair of some 170 steps; making the slope beside them more
like the side of Skiddaw than what it really is, the earthwork
of an unimportant battery.</p>

<p>This design is also remarkable as an instance of that restlessness
which was above noticed even in Turner's least stormy
seas. There is nothing tremendous here in scale of wave,
but the whole surface is fretted and disquieted by torturing
wind; an effect which was always increased during the progress
of the subjects, by Turner's habit of scratching out
small sparkling lights, in order to make the plate "bright,"
or "lively."<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> In a general way the engravers used to like
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>this, and, as far as they were able, would tempt Turner farther
into the practice, which was precisely equivalent to that
of supplying the place of healthy and heart-whole cheerfulness
by dram-drinking.</p>

<p>The two sea-gulls in the front of the picture were additions
of this kind, and are very injurious, confusing the organization
and concealing the power of the sea. The merits
of the drawing are, however, still great as a piece of composition.
The left-hand side is most interesting, and characteristic
of Turner: no other artist would have put the round
pier so exactly under the round cliff. It is under it so
accurately, that if the nearly vertical falling line of that cliff
be continued, it strikes the sea-base of the pier to a hair's
breadth. But Turner knew better than any man the value
of echo, as well as of contrast,&mdash;of repetition, as well as of
opposition. The round pier repeats the line of the main cliff,
and then the sail repeats the diagonal shadow which crosses
it, and emerges above it just as the embankment does above
the cliff brow. Lower, come the opposing curves in the two
boats, the whole forming one group of sequent lines up the
whole side of the picture. The rest of the composition is
more commonplace than is usual with the great master; but
there are beautiful transitions of light and shade between the
sails of the little fishing-boat, the brig behind her, and the
cliffs. Note how dexterously the two front sails<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> of the
brig are brought on the top of the white sail of the fishing-boat
to help to detach it from the white cliffs.</p>

</div></div>


<p>This, though less attractive, at first sight, than the former
plate, is a better example of the master, and far truer and
nobler as a piece of thought. The lifting of the brig on the
wave is very daring; just one of the things which is seen in
every gale, but which no other painter than Turner ever represented;
and the lurid transparency of the dark sky, and wild
expression of wind in the fluttering of the falling sails of the
vessel running into the harbor, are as fine as anything of the
kind he has done. There is great grace in the drawing of
this latter vessel: note the delicate switch forward of her
upper mast.</p>

<p>There is a very singular point connected with the composition
of this drawing, proving it (as from internal evidence
was most likely) to be a record of a thing actually seen.
Three years before the date of this engraving Turner had
made a drawing of Ramsgate for the Southern Coast series.
That drawing represents the <i>same day</i>, the <i>same moment</i>,
and the <i>same ships</i>, from a different point of view. It supposes
the spectator placed in a boat some distance out at sea,
beyond the fishing-boats on the left in the present plate, and
looking towards the town, or into the harbor. The brig, which
is near us here, is then, of course, in the distance on the
right; the schooner entering the harbor, and, in both plates,
lowering her fore-topsail, is, of course, seen foreshortened;
the fishing-boats only are a little different in position and
set of sail. The sky is precisely the same, only a dark piece
of it, which is too far to the right to be included in <i>this</i>
view, enters into the wider distance of the other, and the town,
of course, becomes a more important object.</p>

<p>The persistence in one conception furnishes evidence of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>the very highest imaginative power. On a common mind,
what it has seen is so feebly impressed, that it mixes other
ideas with it immediately; forgets it&mdash;modifies it&mdash;adorns
it,&mdash;does anything but keep <i>hold</i> of it. But when Turner
had once seen that stormy hour at Ramsgate harbor-mouth,
he never quitted his grasp of it. He had <i>seen</i> the two vessels;
one go in, the other out. He could have only seen them at
that one moment&mdash;from one point; but the impression on
his imagination is so strong, that he is able to handle it three
years afterwards, as if it were a real thing, and turn it round
on the table of his brain, and look at it from the other corner.
He will see the brig near, instead of far off: set the whole
sea and sky so many points round to the south, and see how
they look, so. I never traced power of this kind in any other
man.</p>

</div></div>


<p>The drawing for this plate is one of Turner's most remarkable,
though not most meritorious, works: it contains the
brightest rainbow he ever painted, to my knowledge; not the
best, but the most dazzling. It has been much modified in
the plate. It is very like one of Turner's pieces of caprice
to introduce a rainbow at all as a principal feature in such
a scene; for it is not through the colors of the iris that we
generally expect to be shown eighteen-pounder batteries and
ninety-gun ships.</p>

<p>Whether he meant the dark cloud (intensely dark blue
in the original drawing), with the sunshine pursuing it
back into distance; and the rainbow, with its base set on a
ship of battle, to be together types of war and peace, and of
the one as the foundation of the other, I leave it to the reader
to decide. My own impression is, that although Turner
might have some askance symbolism in his mind, the present
design is, like the former one, in many points a simple
reminiscence of a seen fact.<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a></p>

<p>However, whether reminiscent or symbolic, the design is,
to my mind, an exceedingly unsatisfactory one, owing to its
total want of principal subject. The fort ceases to be of
importance because of the bank and tower in front of it; the
ships, necessarily for the effect, but fatally for themselves,
are confused, and incompletely drawn, except the little sloop,
which looks paltry and like a toy; and the foreground objects
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>are, for work of Turner, curiously ungraceful and uninteresting.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, that to some minds the fresh and
dewy space of darkness, so animated with latent human
power, may give a sensation of great pleasure, and at all
events the design is worth study on account of its very strangeness.</p>

</div></div>


<p>I have placed in the middle of the series those pictures
which I think least interesting, though the want of interest
is owing more to the monotony of their character than to any
real deficiency in their subjects. If, after contemplating
paintings of arid deserts or glowing sunsets, we had come
suddenly upon this breezy entrance to the crowded cove of
Plymouth, it would have gladdened our hearts to purpose; but
having already been at sea for some time, there is little in
this drawing to produce renewal of pleasurable impression:
only one useful thought may be gathered from the very feeling
of monotony. At the time when Turner executed these drawings,
his portfolios were full of the most magnificent subjects&mdash;coast
and inland,&mdash;gathered from all the noblest scenery
of France and Italy. He was ready to realize these sketches
for any one who would have asked it of him, but no consistent
effort was ever made to call forth his powers; and the only
means by which it was thought that the public patronage
could be secured for a work of this kind, was by keeping
familiar names before the eye, and awakening the so-called
"patriotic," but in reality narrow and selfish, associations
belonging to well-known towns or watering-places. It is to
be hoped, that when a great landscape painter appears among
us again, we may know better how to employ him, and set
him to paint for us things which are less easily seen, and
which are somewhat better worth seeing, than the mists of
the Catwater, or terraces of Margate.</p>

<h2><a name="V_SHEERNESS" id="V_SHEERNESS"></a>V.&mdash;SHEERNESS.</h2>

</div></div>


<p>I look upon this as one of the noblest sea-pieces which
Turner ever produced. It has not his usual fault of over-crowding
or over-glitter; the objects in it are few and noble,
and the space infinite. The sky is quite one of his best: not
violently black, but full of gloom and power; the complicated
roundings of its volumes behind the sloop's mast, and downwards
to the left, have been rendered by the engraver with
notable success; and the dim light entering along the horizon,
full of rain, behind the ship of war, is true and grand in the
highest degree. By comparing it with the extreme darkness
of the skies in the Plymouth, Dover, and Ramsgate, the
reader will see how much more majesty there is in moderation
than in extravagance, and how much more darkness, as
far as sky is concerned, there is in gray than in black. It is
not that the Plymouth and Dover skies are false,&mdash;such
impenetrable forms of thunder-cloud are amongst the commonest
phenomena of storm; but they have more of spent
flash and past shower in them than the less passionate, but
more truly stormy and threatening, volumes of the sky here.
The Plymouth storm will very thoroughly wet the sails, and
wash the decks, of the ships at anchor, but will send nothing
to the bottom. For these pale and lurid masses, there is no
saying what evil they may have in their thoughts, or what they
may have to answer for before night. The ship of war in the
distance is one of many instances of Turner's dislike to draw
<i>complete</i> rigging; and this not only because he chose to give
an idea of his ships having seen rough service, and being
crippled; but also because in men-of-war he liked the mass
of the hull to be increased in apparent weight and size by
want of upper spars. All artists of any rank share this last
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>feeling. Stanfield never makes a careful study of a hull
without shaking some or all of its masts out of it first, if
possible. See, in the Coast Scenery, Portsmouth harbor,
Falmouth, Hamoaze, and Rye old harbors; and compare,
among Turner's works, the near hulls in the Devonport,
Saltash, and Castle Upnor, and distance of Gosport. The
fact is, partly that the precision of line in the complete spars
of a man-of-war is too formal to come well into pictorial
arrangements, and partly that the chief glory of a ship of
the line is in its aspect of being "one that hath had losses."</p>

<p>The subtle varieties of curve in the drawing of the sails of
the near sloop are altogether exquisite; as well as the contrast
of her black and glistering side with those sails, and with the
sea. Examine the wayward and delicate play of the dancing
waves along her flank, and between her and the brig in ballast,
plunging slowly before the wind; I have not often seen anything
so perfect in fancy, or in execution of engraving.</p>

<p>The heaving and black buoy in the near sea is one of
Turner's "echoes," repeating, with slight change, the head of
the sloop with its flash of luster. The chief aim of this buoy
is, however, to give comparative lightness to the shadowed
part of the sea, which is, indeed, somewhat overcharged in
darkness, and would have been felt to be so, but for this
contrasting mass. Hide it with the hand, and this will be
immediately felt. There is only one other of Turner's works
which, in its way, can be matched with this drawing, namely,
the Mouth of the Humber in the River Scenery. The latter
is, on the whole, the finer picture; but this by much the
more interesting in the shipping.</p>

<p>This plate is not, at first sight, one of the most striking of
the series; but it is very beautiful, and highly characteristic
of Turner.<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a> First, in its choice of subjects: for it seems
very notably capricious in a painter eminently capable of
rendering scenes of sublimity and mystery, to devote himself
to the delineation of one of the most prosaic of English watering-places&mdash;not
once or twice, but in a series of elaborate
drawings, of which this is the fourth. The first appeared in
the Southern Coast series, and was followed by an elaborate
drawing on a large scale, with a beautiful sunrise; then came
another careful and very beautiful drawing in the England
and Wales series; and finally this, which is a sort of poetical
abstract of the first. Now, if we enumerate the English ports
one by one, from Berwick to Whitehaven, round the island,
there will hardly be found another so utterly devoid of all
picturesque or romantic interest as Margate. Nearly all have
some steep eminence of down or cliff, some pretty retiring
dingle, some roughness of old harbor or straggling fisher-hamlet,
some fragment of castle or abbey on the heights above,
capable of becoming a leading point in a picture; but Margate
is simply a mass of modern parades and streets, with a little
bit of chalk cliff, an orderly pier, and some bathing-machines.
Turner never conceives it as anything else; and yet for the
sake of this simple vision, again and again he quits all higher
thoughts. The beautiful bays of Northern Devon and Cornwall
he never painted but once, and that very imperfectly.
The finest subjects of the Southern Coast series&mdash;the Minehead,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>Clovelly, Ilfracombe, Watchet, East and West Looe,
Tintagel, Boscastle&mdash;he never touched again; but he repeated
Ramsgate, Deal, Dover, and Margate, I know not how often.</p>

<p>Whether his desire for popularity, which, in spite of his
occasional rough defiances of public opinion, was always great,
led him to the selection of those subjects which he thought
might meet with most acceptance from a large class of the
London public, or whether he had himself more pleasurable
associations connected with these places than with others, I
know not; but the fact of the choice itself is a very mournful
one, considered with respect to the future interests of art.
There is only this one point to be remembered, as tending to
lessen our regret, that it is possible Turner might have felt
the necessity of compelling himself sometimes to dwell on
the most familiar and prosaic scenery, in order to prevent
his becoming so much accustomed to that of a higher class
as to diminish his enthusiasm in its presence. Into this
probability I shall have occasion to examine at greater length
hereafter.</p>

<p>The plate of Margate now before us is nearly as complete
a duplicate of the Southern Coast view as the previous plate is
of that of Ramsgate; with this difference, that the position
of the spectator is here the same, but the class of ship is
altered, though the ship remains precisely in the same spot.
A piece of old wreck, which was rather an important object
to the left of the other drawing, is here removed. The figures
are employed in the same manner in both designs.</p>

<p>The details of the houses of the town are executed in the
original drawing with a precision which adds almost painfully
to their natural formality. It is certainly provoking to find
the great painter, who often only deigns to bestow on some
Rhenish fortress or French city, crested with Gothic towers,
a few misty and indistinguishable touches of his brush,
setting himself to indicate, with unerring toil, every separate
square window in the parades, hotels, and circulating
libraries of an English bathing-place.</p>

<p>The whole of the drawing is well executed, and free from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>fault or affectation, except perhaps in the somewhat confused
curlings of the near sea. I had much rather have seen it
breaking in the usual straightforward way. The brilliant
white of the piece of chalk cliff is evidently one of the principal
aims of the composition. In the drawing the sea is
throughout of a dark fresh blue, the sky grayish blue, and
the grass on the top of the cliffs a little sunburnt, the cliffs
themselves being left in the almost untouched white of the
paper.</p>

<p>This beautiful drawing is a <i>third</i> recurrence by Turner
to his earliest impression of Portsmouth, given in the Southern
Coast series. The buildings introduced differ only by a
slight turn of the spectator towards the right; the buoy is
in the same spot; the man-of-war's boat nearly so; the sloop
exactly so, but on a different tack; and the man-of-war, which
is far off to the left at anchor in the Southern Coast view,
is here nearer, and getting up her anchor.</p>

<p>The idea had previously passed through one phase of
greater change, in his drawing of "Gosport" for the England,
in which, while the sky of the Southern Coast view was
almost cloud for cloud retained, the interest of the distant
ships of the line had been divided with a collier brig and a
fast-sailing boat. In the present view he returns to his early
thought, dwelling, however, now with chief insistence on the
ship of the line, which is certainly the most majestic of all
that he has introduced in his drawings.</p>

<p>It is also a very curious instance of that habit of Turner's
before referred to (p. {ref}27), of never painting a ship quite in
good order. On showing this plate the other day to a naval
officer, he complained of it, first that "the jib<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a> would not be
wanted with the wind blowing out of harbor," and, secondly,
that "a man-of-war would never have her foretop-gallant sail
set, and her main and mizzen top-gallants furled:&mdash;all the
men would be on the yards at once."</p>

<p>I believe this criticism to be perfectly just, though it has
happened to me, very singularly, whenever I have had the
opportunity of making complete inquiry into any technical
matter of this kind, respecting which some professional person
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>had blamed Turner, that I have always found, in the end,
Turner was right, and the professional critic wrong, owing
to some want of allowance for possible accidents, and for
necessary modes of pictorial representation. Still, this cannot
be the case in every instance; and supposing my sailor
informant to be perfectly right in the present one, the disorderliness
of the way in which this ship is represented as
setting her sails, gives us farther proof of the imperative
instinct in the artist's mind, refusing to contemplate a ship,
even in her proudest moments, but as in some way over-mastered
by the strengths of chance and storm.</p>

<p>The wave on the left hand beneath the buoy, presents a
most interesting example of the way in which Turner used
to spoil his work by retouching. All his truly fine drawings
are either done quickly, or at all events straight forward,
without alteration: he never, as far as I have examined his
works hitherto, altered but to destroy. When he saw a plate
look somewhat dead or heavy, as, compared with the drawing,
it was almost sure at first to do, he used to scratch out little
lights all over it, and make it "sparkling"; a process in
which the engravers almost unanimously delighted,<a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a> and
over the impossibility of which they now mourn, declaring it
to be hopeless to engrave after Turner, since he cannot now
scratch their plates for them. It is quite true that these small
lights were always placed beautifully; and though the plate,
after its "touching," generally looked as if ingeniously salted
out of her dredging-box by an artistical cook, the salting was
done with a spirit which no one else can now imitate. But
the original power of the work was forever destroyed. If
the reader will look carefully beneath the white touches on
the left in this sea, he will discern dimly the form of a round
nodding hollow breaker. This in the early state of the plate
is a gaunt, dark, angry wave, rising at the shoal indicated by
the buoy;&mdash;Mr. Lupton has fac-similed with so singular skill
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>the scratches of the penknife by which Turner afterwards
disguised this breaker, and spoiled his picture, that the plate
in its present state is almost as interesting as the touched
proof itself; interesting, however, only as a warning to all
artists never to lose hold of their first conception. They may
tire even of what is exquisitely right, as they work it out,
and their only safety is in the self-denial of calm completion.</p>

</div></div>


<p>This is one of the most beautiful and best-finished plates
of the series, and Turner has taken great pains with the
drawing; but it is sadly open to the same charges which
were brought against the Dover, of an attempt to reach a
false sublimity by magnifying things in themselves insignificant.
The fact is that Turner, when he prepared these
drawings, had been newly inspired by the scenery of the
Continent; and with his mind entirely occupied by the
ruined towers of the Rhine, he found himself called upon to
return to the formal embrasures and unappalling elevations
of English forts and hills. But it was impossible for him
to recover the simplicity and narrowness of conception in
which he had executed the drawing of the Southern Coast,
or to regain the innocence of delight with which he had once
assisted gravely at the drying of clothes over the limekiln
at Comb Martin, or penciled the woodland outlines of the
banks of Dartmouth Cove. In certain fits of prosaic humorism,
he would, as we have seen, condemn himself to delineation
of the parades of a watering-place; but the moment he
permitted himself to be enthusiastic, vaster imaginations
crowded in upon him: to modify his old conception in the
least, was to exaggerate it; the mount of Pendennis is lifted
into rivalship with Ehrenbreitstein, and hardworked Falmouth
glitters along the distant bay, like the gay magnificence
of Resina or Sorrento.</p>

<p>This effort at sublimity is all the more to be regretted,
because it never succeeds completely. Shade, or magnify, or
mystify as he may, even Turner cannot make the minute
neatness of the English fort appeal to us as forcibly as the
remnants of Gothic wall and tower that crown the Continental
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>crags; and invest them as he may with smoke or sunbeam,
the details of our little mounded hills will not take
the rank of cliffs of Alp, or promontories of Apennine; and
we lose the English simplicity, without gaining the Continental
nobleness.</p>

<p>I have also a prejudice against this picture for being
disagreeably noisy. Wherever there is something serious to
be done, as in a battle piece, the noise becomes an element of
the sublimity; but to have great guns going off in every
direction beneath one's feet on the right, and all round the
other side of the castle, and from the deck of the ship of the
line, and from the battery far down the cove, and from the
fort on the top of the hill, and all for nothing, is to my mind
eminently troublesome.</p>

<p>The drawing of the different wreaths and depths of smoke,
and the explosive look of the flash on the right, are, however,
very wonderful and peculiarly Turneresque; the sky is also
beautiful in form, and the foreground, in which we find
his old regard for washerwomen has not quite deserted him,
singularly skillful. It is curious how formal the whole
picture becomes if this figure and the gray stones beside it
are hidden with the hand.</p>

</div></div>


<p>This drawing has always been interesting to me among
Turner's sea pieces, on account of the noble gathering together
of the great wave on the left,&mdash;the back of a breaker, just
heaving itself up, and provoking itself into passion, before
its leap and roar against the beach. But the enjoyment of
these designs is much interfered with by their monotony: it
is seriously to be regretted that in all but one the view is
taken from the sea; for the spectator is necessarily tired by
the perpetual rush and sparkle of water, and ceases to be
impressed by it. It would be felt, if this plate were seen
alone, that there are few marine paintings in which the weight
and heaping of the sea are given so faithfully.</p>

<p>For the rest it is perhaps more to be regretted that we are
kept to our sea-level at Sidmouth than at any other of the
localities illustrated. What claim the pretty little village
has to be considered as a port of England, I know not; but
if it was to be so ranked, a far more interesting study of it
might have been made from the heights above the town,
whence the ranges of dark-red sandstone cliffs stretching to
the southwest are singularly bold and varied. The detached
fragment of sandstone which forms the principal object in
Turner's view has long ago fallen, and even while it stood
could hardly have been worth the honor of so careful illustration.</p>

</div></div>


<p>As an expression of the general spirit of English coast
scenery, this plate must be considered the principal one of
the series. Like all the rest, it is a little too grand for its
subject; but the exaggerations of space and size are more
allowable here than in the others, as partly necessary to
convey the feeling of danger conquered by activity and commerce,
which characterizes all our northerly Eastern coast.
There are cliffs more terrible, and winds more wild, on other
shores; but nowhere else do so many white sails lean against
the bleak wind, and glide across the cliff shadows. Nor do
I know many other memorials of monastic life so striking as
the abbey on that dark headland. We are apt in our journeys
through lowland England, to watch with some secret contempt
the general pleasantness of the vales in which our
abbeys were founded, without taking any pains to inquire
into the particular circumstances which directed or compelled
the choice of the monks, and without reflecting that, if the
choice were a selfish one, the selfishness is that of the English
lowlander turning monk, not that of monachism; since, if
we examine the sites of the Swiss monasteries and convents,
we shall always find the snow lying round them in July;
and it must have been cold meditating in these cloisters of
St. Hilda's when the winter wind set from the east. It is
long since I was at Whitby, and I am not sure whether
Turner is right in giving so monotonous and severe verticality
to the cliff above which the abbey stands; but I believe
it must have some steep places about it, since the tradition
which, in nearly all parts of the island where fossil ammonites
are found, is sure to be current respecting them, takes
quite an original form at Whitby, owing to the steepness of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>this rock. In general, the saint of the locality has simply
turned all the serpents to stone; but at Whitby, St. Hilda
drove them over the cliff, and the serpents, before being petrified,
had all their heads broken off by the fall!</p>

<p>I have had occasion,<a name="FNanchor_W_23" id="FNanchor_W_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a> elsewhere, to consider at some
length, the peculiar love of the English for neatness and
minuteness: but I have only considered, without accounting
for, or coming to any conclusion about it; and, the more I
think of it, the more it puzzles me to understand what there
can be in our great national mind which delights to such an
extent in brass plates, red bricks, square curbstones, and
fresh green paint, all on the tiniest possible scale. The other
day I was dining in a respectable English "Inn and Posting-house,"
not ten miles from London, and, measuring the room
after dinner, I found it exactly twice and a quarter the
height of my umbrella. It was a highly comfortable room,
and associated, in the proper English manner, with outdoor
sports and pastimes, by a portrait of Jack Hall, fisherman of
Eton, and of Mr. C. Davis on his favorite mare; but why
all this hunting and fishing enthusiasm should like to reduce
itself, at home, into twice and a quarter the height of an
umbrella, I could not in any wise then, nor have I at any
other time been able to ascertain.</p>

<p>Perhaps the town of Deal involves as much of this question
in its aspect and reputation, as any other place in Her Majesty's
dominions: or at least it seemed so to me, coming to
it as I did, after having been accustomed to the boat-life at
Venice, where the heavy craft, massy in build and massy in
sail, and disorderly in aquatic economy, reach with their
mast-vanes only to the first stories of the huge marble palaces
they anchor among. It was very strange to me, after this,
knowing that whatever was brave and strong in the English
sailor was concentrated in our Deal boatmen, to walk along
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>that trim strip of conventional beach, which the sea itself
seems to wash in a methodical manner, one shingle-step at
a time; and by its thin toy-like boats, each with its head to
sea, at regular intervals, looking like things that one would
give a clever boy to play with in a pond, when first he got
past petticoats; and the row of lath cots behind, all tidiness
and telegraph, looking as if the whole business of the human
race on earth was to know what o'clock it was, and when it
would be high water,&mdash;only some slight weakness in favor of
grog being indicated here and there by a hospitable-looking
open door, a gay bow-window, and a sign intimating that it
is a sailor's duty to be not only accurate, but "jolly."</p>

<p>Turner was always fond of this neat, courageous, benevolent,
merry, methodical Deal. He painted it very early, in
the Southern Coast series, insisting on one of the tavern
windows as the principal subject, with a flash of forked
lightning streaming beyond it out at sea like a narrow flag.
He has the same association in his mind in the present
plate; disorder and distress among the ships on the left,
with the boat going out to help them; and the precision of
the little town stretching in sunshine along the beach.</p>

<p>I have put this plate last in the series, thinking that the
reader will be glad to rest in its morning quietness, after so
much tossing among the troubled foam. I said in the course
of the introduction, that nothing is so perfectly calm as
Turner's calmness; and I know very few better examples of
this calmness than the plate before us, uniting, as it does,
the glittering of the morning clouds, and trembling of the
sea, with an infinitude of peace in both. There are one or
two points of interest in the artifices by which the intense
effect of calm is produced. Much is owing, in the first place,
to the amount of absolute gloom obtained by the local blackness
of the boats on the beach; like a piece of the midnight
left unbroken by the dawn. But more is owing to the
treatment of the distant harbor mouth. In general, throughout
nature, Reflection and Repetition are <i>peaceful</i> things;
that is to say, the image of any object, seen in calm water,
gives us an impression of quietness, not merely because we
know the water must be quiet in order to be reflective; but
because the fact of the repetition of this form is lulling to
us in its monotony, and associated more or less with an
idea of quiet succession, or reproduction, in events or things
throughout nature:&mdash;that one day should be like another
day, one town the image of another town, or one history the
repetition of another history, being more or less results of
quietness, while dissimilarity and non-succession are also,
more or less, results of interference and disquietude. And
thus, though an echo actually increases the quantity of
sound heard, its repetition of the notes or syllables of sound,
gives an idea of calmness attainable in no other way; hence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>the feeling of calm given to a landscape by the notes of the
cuckoo. Understanding this, observe the anxious <i>doubling</i> of
every object by a visible echo or shadow throughout this
picture. The grandest feature of it is the steep distant cliff;
and therefore the dualism is more marked here than elsewhere;
the two promontories or cliffs, and two piers below
them, being arranged so that the one looks almost like the
shadow of the other, cast irregularly on mist. In all probability,
the more distant pier would in reality, unless it is
very greatly higher than the near one, have been lowered
by perspective so as not to continue in the same longitudinal
line at the top,&mdash;but Turner will not have it so; he reduces
them to exactly the same level, so that the one looks like the
phantom of the other; and so of the cliffs above.</p>

<p>Then observe, each pier has, just below the head of it, in
a vertical line, another important object, one a buoy, and the
other a stooping figure. These carry on the double group in
the calmest way, obeying the general law of vertical reflection,
and throw down two long shadows on the near beach. The
intenseness of the parallelism would catch the eye in a
moment, but for the lighthouse, which breaks the group and
prevents the artifice from being too open. Next come the
two heads of boats, with their two bowsprits, and the two
masts of the one farthest off, all monotonously double, but
for the diagonal mast of the nearer one, which again hides
the artifice. Next, put your finger over the white central
figure, and follow the minor incidents round the beach; first,
under the lighthouse, a stick, with its echo below a little to
the right; above, a black stone, and its echo to the right;
under the white figure, another stick, with its echo to the left;
then a starfish,<a name="FNanchor_X_24" id="FNanchor_X_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a> and a white spot its echo to the left; then
a dog, and a basket to double its light; above, a fisherman,
and his wife for an echo; above them, two lines of curved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>shingle; above them, two small black figures; above them,
two unfinished ships, and two forked masts; above the forked
masts, a house with two gables, and its echo exactly over it
in two gables more; next to the right, two fishing-boats with
sails down; farther on, two fishing-boats with sails up, each
with its little white reflection below; then two larger ships,
which, lest his trick should be found out, Turner puts a dim
third between; then below, two fat colliers, leaning away
from each other, and two thinner colliers, leaning towards
each other; and now at last, having doubled everything all
round the beach, he gives one strong single stroke to gather
all together, places his solitary central white figure, and the
Calm is complete.</p>

<p>It is also to be noticed, that not only the definite repetition
has a power of expressing serenity, but even the slight sense
of <i>confusion</i> induced by the continual doubling is useful;
it makes us feel not well awake, drowsy, and as if we were
out too early, and had to rub our eyes yet a little, before we
could make out whether there were really two boats or one.</p>

<p>I do not mean that every means which we may possibly
take to enable ourselves to see things double, will be always
the most likely to insure the ultimate tranquillity of the
scene, neither that any such artifice as this would be of avail,
without the tender and loving drawing of the things themselves,
and of the light that bathes them; nevertheless the
highest art is full of these little cunnings, and it is only by
the help of them that it can succeed in at all equaling the
force of the natural impression.</p>

<p>One great monotony, that of the successive sigh and vanishing
of the slow waves upon the sand, no art can render to
us. Perhaps the silence of early light, even on the "field dew
consecrate" of the grass itself, is not so tender as the lisp
of the sweet belled lips of the clear waves in their following
patience. We will leave the shore as their silver fringes
fade upon it, desiring thus, as far as may be, to remember
the sea. We have regarded it perhaps too often as an enemy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>to be subdued; let us, at least this once, accept from it, and
from the soft light beyond the cliffs above, the image of the
state of a perfect Human Spirit,&mdash;</p>

which was printed upon the center of the front wrapper of each. As
<i>The Ports of England</i> is an exceptionally scarce book, and as the
vignette can be obtained in no other form, a facsimile of it is here
given. The original drawing was presented by Mr. Ruskin to the Fitz-William
Museum, at Cambridge, where it may now be seen.</p></div>

were accordingly "retouched" by Mr. Chas. A. Tomkins. But such
retouching proved worse than useless. The delicacy of the finer work
had entirely vanished, and the plates remained but a ghost of their
former selves, such as no one would recognize as doing justice to
Turner. The fifth is unquestionably the least satisfactory of the five
original editions containing Lupton's engravings.</p></div>

remuneration.</p></div>

"The Queen upon her throne holds with one hand the scepter, in the
other the balance. Minerva and Cupid are at her sides. Abundance
and Prosperity distribute metals, laurels, 'et d'autres r&eacute;compenses,'
to the Genii of the Fine Arts. Time, crowned with the productions of

"crowned with the productions of the seasons," was, meanwhile, as
Thomas Carlyle would have told us, "quite of another opinion."

of the state, under the emblem of a vessel, of which he holds the
rudder."

to, is accordingly recommended to the reader's serious attention.</p></div>
